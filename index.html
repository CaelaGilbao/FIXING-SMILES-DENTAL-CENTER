                            <li>During a dental checkup or recall exam, your dentist is trained to look for oral health problems that you can’t always see or feel – problems like deterioration of fillings, early signs of gum disease or oral cancer, and other problems that could affect your general health.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>At the end of this appointment, you will have a more thorough understanding of the condition of your teeth and mouth, as well as all options for treatment. This provides you with all the information needed to choose the treatment that’s right for you.
                            </li>

                            <li>It is very important to see your dentist every six months in order to treat any problems and prevent further complications that will cost you a lot.
                            </li>

                            <li>A dental filling or also known as pasta is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay 
                                back to its normal function and shape. When a dentist gives you a filling, he or she first removes the decayed tooth material, cleans the affected area, and then fills the cleaned out cavity with a filling material.
                            </li>
                            <li>Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken teeth and teeth that have been worn 
                                down from misuse such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding. The dentist will tell you what type of restorative material will be used depending on the case of your tooth.

                            <li>An oral prophylaxis is a dental procedure that is performed to help reduce the risk of 		gum and tooth disease. Also known simply as a prophylaxis or prophy, this dental 		
                                procedure is recommended to be taken every six months or yearly, depending on a patient’s history.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During a dental prophylaxis, your dentist will also inspect your teeth and jaw for any obvious signs of ill health. This inspection may reveal underlying medical issues such as receding gums, erupting wisdom teeth, dental cavities, or even oral cancer – some of which will require immediate treatment. Early identification of dental problems can help you deal with them before they become serious. 
                            </li>

                                <li>Fluoride's primary benefit is that it helps prevent tooth decay. It can also reverse erosion that has already taken place. If plaque forms on the teeth and eats away at the enamel, fluoride treatments can replace the minerals in the enamel that have eroded. This allows teeth to remain healthy.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>Fluoride treatments are especially important for children under the age of six. Even though these young children don’t have their permanent teeth yet, fluoride treatments can prevent bacteria build-up around the gums, fight gingivitis, and help establish long-term dental health.
                                </li>

                                <li>You and your dentist may determine that you need a tooth extraction for any number of reasons. Some teeth are extracted because they are severely decayed; others may have advanced periodontal disease, or have broken in a way that cannot be repaired. Other teeth may need removal because they are poorly positioned in the mouth (such as impacted teeth), or in preparation for orthodontic treatment.
                                </li>
                                <li>The removal of a single tooth can lead to problems related to your chewing ability, problems with your jaw joint, and shifting teeth, which can have a major impact on your dental health.

                                <li>A dental veneer is a thin layer or shell of material that covers the front
                                    visible part of your tooth. It is similar in concept to how fake nails are stuck onto your real ones.

                                    Porcelain veneers can improve shape, color and position (if minor) all at once. Therefore if you have a range of cosmetic flaws such as spaces, discolouration, staining, chipped or fractured teeth, these can all be dealt with at the same time. A combined approach using other treatments may be needed depending on the situation.

                                <li>A bridge is fixed in your mouth so you don't have to worry about it falling while you are speaking or laughing. There is no need to take it out and clean it like a denture. You just have to follow a special cleaning instruction from your dentist.
                                </li>

                                <li>Based on studies fixed bridgework, like individual crowns, is very predictable,
                                durable and lasts a considerable length of time and it could even last a lifetime. Though it may sometimes come loose or fall out. With proper care and good oral hygiene, it is a good investment.
